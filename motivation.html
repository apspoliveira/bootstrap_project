                    <p>My name is António Oliveira and I am from Coimbra. I have a degree and a PhD in
                        Computer Engineering from the University of Coimbra.</p>
                    <p>In the final work of Degree I improved software in the area of Software Engineering and
                        Artificial intelligence. This work is part of a research project. During
                        my PhD I was involved in the areas of affective computing and musical computing
                        at the Center for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra. I developed a system of
                        music production according to emotions. This work resulted in a thesis of
                        doctorate entitled "A Musical System for Emotional Expression".</p>
                    <p>I started my professional activity of teaching Higher Education in the academic year 2015/2016

                        Artificial. In the 2016/2017 school year, I continued this activity at the Escola Superior de
                        Technology and Management of Viseu giving practical classes in the disciplines of Programming
                        Computers and Algorithms and Programming.</p>

                        improving a Call Detail Records database and obtaining statistical measurements
                        details about Call Detail Records. From December 2017 to February 2018 I collaborated in
                        initial phase of a project exploring technologies and templates with the aim of
                        development of an application for managing restaurant customer orders. At the
                        period from September 2017 to September 2018, being linked to a co-work space
                        from Instituto Pedro Nunes, I developed a web email client inspired by the web client made
                        for Protonmail. From May 2019 to October 2019 I was a web programmer analyst at
                        company Coimfor, being directed my work in the improvement and development for the
                        GCIWeb application oriented to management and accounting. From October 2019 to February 2019

                        SMSBUZZ application for sending SMS messages; collaboration in the development of
